## 📜 About The Project

This repository hosts the source code for the official web platform of **Młodzi OZZIP**, the youth section of the  All-Poland Trade Union Workers' Initiative (Ogólnopolski Związek Zawodowy "Inicjatywa Pracownicza").

As a non-profit, volunteer-driven project, I wanted to build a modern, secure, and user-friendly web app that presents organization activities.

### 💻 Built With

The web application is built on a few known open-source technologies.

*   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
*   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (for fast development and optimized builds)
*   [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (as a Backend-as-a-Service for database and authentication)
*   [Cloudflare Workers/Pages](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) (for deployment and middleware)

## ✨ Features

My goal is to provide a comprehensive suite of features to meet the student union needs:

*   **📢 News & Category Feeds :** The news and categories feeds, which can be pinned as a sidebar menu item.
*   **🔍 Categories Filtering & Search :** Easily filter by categories or search keywords of the news articles.
*   **📄 Static Pages :** Visible and hidden from sidebar navigation via setting.
*   **📚 Resource Center:** Ebooks and downloads components with meta data fields and cover images.
*   **🌐 Structures Listing:** A map showing local student unions with contact information.
*   **🗓️ Customized RichTextEditor:** HugeRTE with custom plugins like gallery or social media embeds.
*   **🔐 Secure Admin Panel:** Very user-friendly admin panel that lets you add/edit/remove content and change more general settings (like sidebar menu item ordering or Lucide icons)
*   **🔗 Dynamic SEO and OG tags:** Integrate with a middleware to let crawlers properly render your content.
*   **📱 Touch and Mobile Optimized:** Each component was tested on various devices and browsers for smooth and intuitive UX.
*   **...and a lot more hidden inside!**
